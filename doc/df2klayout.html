<h1>Convert an DFII technology file into KLayout format</h1>

Start the Cadence icfb tool and call the "Technology Tool Box". Then press the "Dump" 
button in the tool box. In the "Technology Library" pulldown select the OA technology library
you want to dump. Please make sure that that you only switch the "layerDefinitions" toggle
to "On". Fill out the textbox with name of the output ASCII technology file. Then push the "OK"
button to write out the technology file.

<p>
Then locate the current "display.drf" file in the virtuoso run directory. It coIf not found then
please take a look at the technology directory, which should contain the original version of
the display.drf file. The display.drf file contains color and layer visibility and style 
defintions, fill pattern and line style information.

As third item we need a copy of the OpenAccess stream layer map file. It should reside in the
technology library and is usually called "streamin.layermap". It will contain a mapping
between OA layer/OA purpose to GDSII layer number and GDSII datatype. Here is an exmaple:

# Layer Name        Layer purpose               GDSII layer
