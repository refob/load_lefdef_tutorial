<h1>The easy way to load LEF/DEF</h1>

We start with downloding the tutorial data from <a href="https://sami.klayout.org/">KLayout's Salt Mine</a>.
In KLayout run the command "Tools>Manage Packages". From there please install the package "load_lefdef_tutorial".
After the installation procedure is finished you will find the tutorial data in the directory 
~/.klayout/salt/load_lefdef_tutorial in your Linux file system. Please change into that directory and
continue from there.
<p>
The tutorial directory contains several input files that we will use with KLayout. We start with the 
conversion of Cadence OpenAccess technology data. The set of files consists of an ASCII OpenAccess techology
file, the display.drf and the OpenAccess GDSII layer map file. First we start KLayout reading the import_tf.rbm
Ruby code that implements a simple tech converter. We also have to provide a sample GDSII input file 
otherwise the startup will fail with an "error no view selected". I've prepared a Makefile for you to make
typing easier - just run "make setup". This will execute the following command:
<p>
<pre>
	klayout -rm input/klayout/import_tf_27012017.rbm input/gds/fifo.gds
</pre>
<p>
Now you should see this KLayout window on your screen:
<p><img src="init.png" width="100%"><p>

Then we will run the tech converter. Please execute now "File>Import Cadence Techfile". As a result
you get a window that allows you to define the input technology file for the converter. Please
select the file "NCSU_Techlib_tsmc02_laydefs.tf" that can be found in the subdirectory "input/oa".

<p><img src="select_cdns_techfile.png" width="80%"><p>

Please note that the technoloy converter will automaticly pick up the the file "display.drf"
found in the same directory. It will also search for files with the extension ".layermap" and
if found it will also read it und use it for the conversion. If everything went fine you should
see this window on your screen:

<p><img src="tech_import.png" width="100%"><p>

The Layers window shows the layer names found in the OA technology file. If a streammap file
was used then you will also see meaningfull GDSII layer numbers and datatypes. If there was
no map file then these numbers are just artificially calculated. The layers should also show
the expected layer pattern that were found in the "display.drf" file.
<p>
In the next step we will save a copy of the KLayout layer data. Please run "File>Save Layer Properties"
and enter "demo.lyp" as output name.

<p><img src="save_layer_props.png" width="80%"><p>

Were are done with this step, so enter now "File>Exit" to terminate this session. You can take a
look at "demo.lyp" file. It uses XML format and contains all layer relevant data used by KLayout.
<p>
From now on we will use this file that you have created. Using your prefered editor please change
the top of the "Makefile" to point to your new file:
<p>
<pre>
#LAYPROPS=output/df2-0.24.10-1.1.lyp
#LAYPROPS=output/df2-0.27-0.lyp
#LAYPROPS=output/oa-0.27-0.lyp
LAYPROPS=demo.lyp
</pre>
<p>
We will now test the new technology by reading a GDSII example file. Please execute "make gds" in
your shell window. This will run the command:
<p>
<pre>
	klayout -l demo.lyp input/gds/fifo.gds
</pre>
<p>
If successful you will get this output:

<p><img src="gds1.png" width="100%"><p>

Zoom into the upper left corner using the right mouse button and enter the "1" hotkey to see
this detail:

<p><img src="gds2.png" width="100%"><p>

With the "*" hotkey you can display the full hierarchy of this layout:

<p><img src="gds3.png" width="100%"><p>

Were done with this example. Please exit KLayout. In the next step we want to display a LEF/DEF-based
design. Please enter "make lefdef" in your shell window. This will execute this command:
<p>
<pre>
	klayout -l demo.lyp \
		-rd layermap="../klayout/cmos180.encmap" \
		-rd leftech="../lef/cmos180.lef" \
		-rd lefcell="../lef/cmos180osu.lef" \
		-rd def="input/def/fifo.def" \
		-rx -rm input/klayout/load_lefdef.rb
</pre>
<p>
The main design file is "input/def/fifo.def". It contains the top level of the design. It useds cell
definitions that are defined in "cmos180osu.lef". This file is looked up relative to the location of
the DEF file. We also have to read the LEF techology file called "cmos180.lef". This file contains the
layer definitions, connectivity informations and basic design rule data in the LEF/DEF space. The Ruby
code in "load_lefdef.rb" tells KLayout to read the data from the at command level defined variables.
<p>
Now we have to take a look at the  "cmos180.encmap" file. The format that the file uses is described in
the Cadence Encounter System User Guide in the section Importing and Exporting Design. Let's take a look
at the details here:
<p>
<pre>
DIEAREA		ALL		100	0
#COMP		ALL		101	0

metal1		NET		49	0
metal1		SPNET		49	0
metal1		PIN		81	0
NAME		metal1/PIN	81	0
metal1		LEFPIN		81	0
NAME		metal1/LEFPIN	109	0
metal1		LEFOBS		49	5

via		VIA		50	0
via		LEFOBS		50	5

</pre>
This file maps the LEF/DEF constructs into GDSII layer and datatypes. The "DIEAREA ALL" will put 
the data into GDSII layer 100 with datatype 0. This layer is already defined in KLayout as layer
with the name "prBoundary.drawing - 100/0". The lines starting with a layer name do the mapping
using a function name. NET maps the regular routing shapes and SPNET does it for the special
routing. PIN defines the layer and datatype for the DEF pins. LEFPIN sets it for the LEF pins.
LEFOBS defines the layer target for the LEF obstructions. The NAME directive instructs the tool
to generate a text label either for DEF pins or for LEF pins.
<p>
Lines starting with via translate via data. Either for VIA into the target via drawing layer for
the DEF top level or using LEFOBS as via obstructions shapes for the LEF cell data.
<p>
Here is the result after reading the LEF/DEF data:

<p><img src="lefdef1.png" width="100%"><p>

Zoom into the upper left corner using the right mouse button and enter the "1" hotkey to see
this detail:

<p><img src="lefdef2.png" width="100%"><p>

Enter the hotkey "*" to see the full details of the LEF cells. 

<p><img src="lefdef3.png" width="100%"><p>

Run "File>Setup" and select the topic "Display>Texts". Here enter for "Text Font" Times
and set the "Standard Text Size" to 0.2. Apply text scaling and also "Show properties".
Once you click on Apply you will see this result - the user properties containing the 
DEF net name will show up on the screen.

<p><img src="lefdef4.png" width="100%"><p>

Then run "File>Setup" and select the topic "Display>Cells". Here enter for "Cell Box Color"
instead of "Auto" the value for "#31" and apply the change. This will give you a result
simiiar to this one:

<p><img src="lefdef5.png" width="100%"><p>
